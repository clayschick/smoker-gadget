  Documentation for the PID Controller.

  Use this as a main page along with the README. Or link this
  to the README.

  Since I want this to be like a library I should use the
  adapters here. Have an `input_adapter` and an `output_adapter`.
  That's pretty much what I have going with this Pancho project
  and the fact that the Pid and the Ui applications are deps
  of the Fw. The Pid and Ui could also be deps of other apps
  like Budgetron. So design it to be extensable and accept any
  input and any output.
